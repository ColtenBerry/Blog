I did not have much trouble creating the models, but there were times I was confused on how the entities related to each other. For example, an item seemed to be a seperate entity that would be added to an order. However, it would make sense that the customer is the one to add an item to the order, so does that mean that an item and order should not have a relationship with each other? That did not seem like the answer because they clearly do have a relationship with each other as items are a part of the order. A similar problem arose, where I was unsure where to put the quantity of items wanted in an order. Would it be related to an order or to the specific item? Problems similar to this arose, but I believe that I have made diagrams that accurately represent what is going on in the relationship.
I felt that the relationships between the entities were self-explanatory, with the customer creating an order and adding items to said order. While there were certainly difficulties in trying to figure out how the relationship could be shown, I feel that I have done it well. The customer can create an order and will add items to said order. The order has attributes, such as pickup or delivery date, an ID, as well as the ID of the items and customer. The customer has attributes such as phone number, address, and name. Each item has attributes such as ID, name, cost, quantity, and a description.
I feel like implementing this model would be fairly simple, but I tend to underestimate the difficulty of projects such as this. I believe this would be fairly easy to implement if I was using a language I was more comfortable with, such as java, but I believe that with an appropriate amount of time, this could easily be done with the tools given to me in class.
