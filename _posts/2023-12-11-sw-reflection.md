There were a number of skills and talents that I feel were essential in accomplishing the project. First, communication with both my groupmates and our community partners were absolutely essential. Unfortuntately, I have never considered myself particularly good at communication. Over the years, and especially in college, my communication skills have certainly gotten better, but I have never considered them to be particularly good. Another skill that was essential in this project was the ability to problem solve. There were numerous problems that me and my group had to face and each one required a solution that often was not obvious from the beginning. The ability to think outside the box and come up with solutions to problems we haven't learned in class was essential. Again, I unfortunately have never been particularly good at getting creative solutions, but after taking so many computer science courses, I have definitely gotten better at it.

The social aspect of this project was certainly rewarding. The process of helping a member of the community, especially the faculty of the college I attend, was definitely extremely rewarding. And the work I did for my community partner will certainly impact the community for the better. While the effects may not be particularly far reaching, the amount of time saved for two of Hendrix's faculty will be massive and that, to me, is enough to justify putting in so much effort to this project. The time that they save will be able to be used on the community, hopefully furthering the reach that this project has.

I have always believed in helping people, and this experience solidified this belief. Recieving the appreciation of our community partners was without a doubt extremely rewarding. All of my computer science knowledge was extremely helpful in completing this project. I had to make use of all my knowledge and experience in order to solve issues that I have never encountered before. Classes will still undoubtably challenge me, but with the experience I gained with this project, I will be far more prepared to deal with those challenges.

I have always believed in charitable actions and helping the community whenever able. I have made efforts to help my community through my basketball program, through my church, now I have done it through one of my college courses. This has certainly opened my eyes to other ways that I can assist the community with my experience and knowledge in the field of computer science. Throughout my college career, I will only gain more knowledge and I will certainly find more opportunities to volunteer my time and knowledge.
