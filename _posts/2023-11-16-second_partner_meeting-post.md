I did not feel this partner meeting was particularly productive, and that is not the fault of poor communication nor any lack of effort. Instead, I feel like we have had a solid understanding of our task since our first partner meeting. So, we showed them our mockups and they seemed pleased with what we had. Styling was also discussed, but it was quite simple. They just wanted Hendrix colors and fonts. This should be quite easy to implement. As it stands right now, I will most likely be the person to do the styling and CSS work. My role on the team feels like it has taken a bit of a backseat. Noah and Ian are extremely active, especially while I am preoccupied with basketball and other commitments. It feels like I do not have much of a chance to get work done before they jump on it. So, I try to understand what they are doing and I help out wherever I can.
