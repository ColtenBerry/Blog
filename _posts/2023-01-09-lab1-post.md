I did not find this lab particularly difficult, as most of it was simply rearranging pre-existing structures on this blog. However, the styling portion of this lab was slightly more difficult for me as I have a hard time being artistic and making things look good. I also had a particularly difficult time adding photos. I don't know if I was simply doing something wrong, but I couldn't get the photes on the website using md, instead I had to add in an html section. Also, I had a difficult time sizing the photos correctly. I believe I got them into a decent place right now, but I would like to learn how I should be doing this because the way I am doing it does not seem to be doing a very good job. howdy
