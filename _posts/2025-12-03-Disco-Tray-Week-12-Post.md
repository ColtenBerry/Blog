<p>At our previous Disco Tray Meeting we presented our progress to the other members in the Game Dev Team. We did not get very many issues out of this meeting, so we made issues we could find and left for Thanksgiving Break. This week I managed to finish the issues that were assigned to me. Those issues were a back button on the login / register screen, and a datepicker for the blurbs. Both of these would improve the user experience greatly as it would allow someone to back out of logging in if they wished to remain anonymous. Adding a datepicker makes it more clear what the user is supposed to be inputting into the date field. It also removes any need for typing which is nice for the user.</p>

<p>These were smaller issues than what I typically do in a week, but with the holidays and the app nearing completion I was happy to take a small break from the project and just get a few minor issues finished. Hopefully next week we will either find more issues or we will begin populating the app with real historical sites in Faulkner County. I have yet to hear back from our community partner, so we will most likely begin by just finding sites that seem important and making our own posts for them. Hopefully this will be a fun process. </p>
