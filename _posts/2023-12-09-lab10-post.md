The way my group divided up the work was Ian would do the first two steps, I would do steps 3 and 4, and Noah would do the rest of the steps. What I found to be the most difficult step was step 3, deploying the sample code. I had an extremely difficult time getting the website to build and deploy. I had ran into problems concerning the database connection strings, updates to dotnet, and I tried numerous different things to fix this. After I got it fixed, step 4, generate database schema, was also rather difficult. For both of these steps, I had to go to office hours to resolve the issues. I feel that my steps were more difficult than my partners steps, but seeing as how they were focusing more on the work for our grid, which was extremely important, I felt that the tasks were divided somewhat evenly.
