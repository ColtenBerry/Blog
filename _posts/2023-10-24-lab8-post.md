This lab was not particularly difficult, it was mostly just copying and pasting what was in the tutorial. Most of the difficulty I had was simply trying to understand what was happening in the tutorial. I feel like after redoing the tutorial, but making my own modifications really helped my understand what was happening and how the page fit together. It was not particularly difficult to make modifications when making my own page, as it was mostly renaming things and creating new fields and getting them to work. While I still am not completely certain about every step I took and why I took that step, I feel that I understand enough to make my own page and modify it to suite my needs. 
The Jekyll framework and Razor frameworks feel rather similar. They are similar in the sense that they all have a number of pages that seem to link to each other and modify the content on each other. The main differences seem to be that the Razor frameworks use C#, which feels far more complicated than the languages jekyll uses. Also, I noticed I had to use the terminal a lot for Razor frameworks, and that adds another layer of complexity to understanding what I am doing and why I am doing it.
