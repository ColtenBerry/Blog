Today my group presented our mockups of our website. I am confident in what we have created as it matches all of our use and user cases and does what it is supposed to do. It looks clean, even though it is a little bit lacking in color, but that is ultimately not too important. To be entirely honest, it is a little bit difficult to contribute meaningfully because of my obligations with basketball, which have taken up much of my time. Additionally, Noah is such a great groupmate that he typically gets things done before I feel like I have had an honest chance to work on them. But that is a good problem to have and I am content with pointing out any potential flaws in his work. As of right now, it seems that me and Ian will be responsible for creating the table itself that will become the seating chart. Right now we are designing the website using mockups, but pretty soon we will have to do the actual thing.
